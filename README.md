# Open-Digital-Twins

## Problem
* Digital twins will dominate the 4th digitalization wave; cyber-physical integration.â€‹

* There are several digital twin platforms (e.g., GE, Dassault) and all of them store data in proprietary way, which were developed to never shared data.

* There is a tremendous potential for a framework that enables existing proprietary digital twin platforms to share data in a decentralized, reliable and secure way.

## Solution 
* We developed a framework that uses an IPFS, BigchainDB, Ethereum based storage solution, and we leverage Ethereum to build a decentralized ecosystem that allows data sellers to register their data, and data buyers to buy it.
